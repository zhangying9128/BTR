{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programmes such as films and series ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Series became so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching series on their technology items , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed by TV series and they lose their social life as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Lastly but not leastly , youngsters are interested in fashion ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that they are very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should regard all of these young people 's interests if the orginisers want it to be a success ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["A topic that I like so much is about electricity ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["It is present in your personal computer , lamps and anything which you need to plug it in ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["But almost no one knows is that the electricity travels a long way to arrive in your houses ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The journey starts in the plant of energy , wherein the electricity is generate by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy and other methods ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then , the electrical energy travels even the substation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["After this , the electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive in your house without troubles and it occurs in a place called substation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , we need to thought very well before to waste energy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Because it is an expensive cost for you and mainly for the environment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["ESSAY"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some people believe that it 's waste of time and a bad habit too , while some others think that it 's a good way to spend your free time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To my mind there pros and cons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First of all , computer games can help you to escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Apart from that , quite convenient mainly because you stay at home and have entertainment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also video games are interesting than traditional toys so they capture teenager 's interest ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Last but not least , some of them are educational and give you the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , there are many drawbacks ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To begin when you spend a lot of hours in the computer screen you become addicted to them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , you do n't get together with your friends and you do n't communicate face to face ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addiction , a lot of video games are full of violence and teens are tend to imitate them so they have violent and aggressive behavior ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["I feel the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We now have ATM , automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers !"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they also have \" impersonalized \" the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \" fast enough \" ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Interraction with humans in some places is extinct ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interraction between people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , it is also very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a common fact machines do fail !"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on - coming obstical is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?"]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["It 's a move that all people could see ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["i think i find it exciting because i love all film like them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["this great move is about a group of people that go to the secondary school , this school its not like all school , its different because you a lot of activity 's like basketball , theater , etc ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox 's getting at his chickens ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel , it is just the way of life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The fox is then chased until it is caught ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A few people enjoy the sport and allows them to socalise ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as it is very cruel ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Anouther reason why it should not be banned is because foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned and a more reasonable death should be considered ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["REPORT"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This report will deal with whether cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities or not ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Cons"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First , local sellers ' work could be damaged in that area because they could need to upload and download goods for the shops ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Second , people who lives in that part of the city could be affected in a negative way because they could need to pass through it with some cars so as to get home ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion it would be a good idea to do it but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There is an opinion that computers will be used instead of books in the future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I believe that it is true , because computers are more convenient and easier to use ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Tablets are light and you can give only it without caring many heavy books ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal , technical and physical barriers ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Despite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers , whereas Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation , movement , work and many other realms , there are also many disadvantages in store , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , the aeroplane is treated as an ordinary aspect of our life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , a few decades ago we had a very limited notion of such a technology ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Yet , in the present , so ubiquitous it is that we seem not to take notice of air business ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If one were to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , they would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We tend to underrate the importance of the Aeroplane ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is clearly obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conceive the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , as a result of its development we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People have ample opportunities to set off on a riveting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides , the great influence of the Aeroplane may be seen in mass emigration ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Since the 20th century was about wars , we would only kill and exterminate people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Additionally , creating such a vehicle was our morbid fascination since the time immemorial ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalised ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Air travel has converted from luxury at the rich 's disposal to a common thing available for almost everyone ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I personally believe that the influence , which the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , yet we have to bear in mind dangers connected with it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For instance , at the beginning of 21st century tourists have been under the constant threat of terrorists ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , the opportunities which air technology brings may easily contribute to further development ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Perhaps , it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London would be in the twinkling of an eye ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To sum up , air business and its changes have been important for the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Apart from minute drawbacks , we can only laud its benefits ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It has certainly had and edifying effect on our thinking of travelling ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many years ago , people lived without all things we have nowadays , it is , mobile phones , LED TV 's , computers , etc ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This means that we have experimented an important change with the passing of time , it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people 's life change ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Now , will we continue developing our technology and our life ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From my point of view , technology will continue changing our life in aspects of routine , free time , up to the point that we will not be able to live without using them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a problem , we must not depend on items like phones , TV , and all items created by technology ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency about technology , we would not able to life in this way , I am sure of it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nonetheless , I think that people 's life will improve thanks to the technology , not only is referring to bad things like the dependency of technology , it offers us interesting things like new technologies , new informatics systems in order to improve the world of job , the improvement in a wide range of job sectors , agriculture , healthy system , etc ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Finally , in order to sum up , I think that people 's life will change , but not dramatically , it depends on each person and the way in which people focus their lives ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there are other solutions like the platform of internet that is about sharing the car for a relative low price with people that is going to go to the same destination ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money but also it is more comfortable than travel with a lot of people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First of all , public transport have less combinations ; it is too difficult to travel for example , if you had to work at nocturne hours and in special days it is impossible to catch a seat ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , if you have lost the bus , train or any other public transport , you had to wait a long time between them and it results maddering ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it speaking with native speakers ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , I doubt that we will have lots of opportunities to speak abroad as we do not know many people there ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules better ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I think that we should travel abroad so as to practise a language but not to study it ."]]}
