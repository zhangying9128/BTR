{"gec_outputs": [["What is genetic risk ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People get certain diseases because of genetic changes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The opposite is also true ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When we are diagnosed with certain genetic diseases , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["My answer is no ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On one hand , we do not want this potential danger having frightening effects in our families ' later lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When people around us know that we have certain diseases , their attitude will easily change , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted and worry about these problems ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we never know when the '' potential bomb '' will explode ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the scope of the whole family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if exercising is helpful reducing family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to do exercise ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["so we keep track of all family members health conditions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who have got this disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Here I want to share Forests 's view on this issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious . \""]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nothing is absolutely right or wrong ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a certain genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and tell others , it is OK to disclose the result ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Above all , life is more important than secrets ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic risk does carry consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another even if the families have a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise to his or her relative , is solely a matter of preference within the individual moral system ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable . Although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - their maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousins ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This knowledge may be relevant to them or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is hereditary ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Does one who suffers from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In retrospect , its is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks on their own ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sometimes some family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parentparent who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being ' allowed ' to tell ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , within a family , regardless of who first receives genetic information , parents are seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring at risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they might not want to know ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , there are also tensions if participants feel that they can neither pass on information to relatives who need to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The notion of authority also extends ' vertically ' ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non - blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal morality and the nature of how ' directive ' the risk is to them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his / her close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that his / her familay members are able to perform some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the corresponding flows ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , although the burden of carrying genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I agree with this statement to a large extent ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I begin by focusing on the negative side of genetic risk first ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Large numbers of patients with genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance to carry certain diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Especially for unmarried young people marrige who are known to have some genetic risk , there may be a certain chance that his / her child would carry the same disease , but this is not certain ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , to keep the information as secret to his / her future spouse would help the relationship ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this issue . Although the factor might not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future ; thus go to hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , the fear of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to keep privacy , it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First , for the case of marriage , a person should be honest and tell his / her spouse they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offspring ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and a certain type of genetic disease is found ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is better for both parties to be honest ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the birth gene together with their daily habits ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if a carrier is told that he / she has the risk to have diabetes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake of too much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with diabetes in the future without any prevention ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , we can see that the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carrier 's relatives outweighs the costs ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercise ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic disorder may or may not be inherited a hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a long term discussion whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by genes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can not make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is immoral and impractical ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , someone having any kind of disease belongs to his or her privacy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a law requires someone to tell others his or her privacy especially when one is not willing to do so ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["it is against his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The law 's spirit also includes fairness ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is unfair to release a law which only points to genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , it is impractical to make such a law ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A good law should be clear and easy to execute ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmothers sisters sons daughters and ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If you say he needs to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of the law ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Other relatives may have the same possibilities of developing a disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , from the ethical point of view ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["too the carrier himself of herself , he or she should have a feeling of responsibility to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By doing this , they may be able to save some lives of their relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is because a carrier with bad genes may not necessary have those genetic diseases , if they can have a corresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function becomes stronger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A typical example is genetically caused by hypertension ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make it harder to digest the fat and salt in blood ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People usually get this kind of hypertesion when they become adult ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["they can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In a nutshell , our society can not push a genetic problem carrier to tell about his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By doing so , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , it might become a controversial issue or a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the knowledge of genetic risk is shared with the family or relatives , there might be chances for them to have it in their blood also , which may force them to take necessary precautions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon receiving the news about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , some carriers will prefer to keep it as a secret ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some say that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as personal personal information which should be kept confidential ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Most patients will be depressed after discovering their condition ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might end up disheartening his extended family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , some see it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , others may think that it is considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , it depends on what kind of genetic diseases , are present in the context of current medical technology ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is discovered in the early stages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of person with genetic disease will do a medical check - up , which might aid them in realising it at an earlier stage ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , some think that it might be better for relatives to remain ignorant about it because they will continue leading a happy life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of disease , will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["All - in - all , it depends on individuals and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Having genetic testing can cause a difficult personal decision because a patient can be given the kowledge that there is a possiblity that he or she could be a carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing . to be sure that there is no risk at all ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Early pre - examination is preferable as it will cast away unwanted doubts but will affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his / her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the genetic risk carrier is a minor , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , much thought needs to be put into the immediate family as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some families may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on receiving the knowledge of such a genetic disorder running in their family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , they have a to play and a responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other members within the same family tree ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevent the genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , this known information will help relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal health ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and this may aid them in making decisions in the future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is has been made known to them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure that the genetic risk carrier is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A person with a disorder , regardless of whether it is a mental or physical disorder , , is happy to be cared for by his or her family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic disorder inheritance is from generation to generation , but not all of the offspring shows the relevant symptoms ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , in the case that when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware if the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Afterwards the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the disorder symptoms are discovered on a child , the parent will be informed by the medics , then the whole family will stay alert to their body 's condition ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In contrast , if the carrier is an adult , and is responsible to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Let 's us look at another possibility : if a child of the family knows that he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might be passed to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In China , the older generation with traditional cultural backgrounds , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family increase and grow stronger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The underlying reason is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to have more children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["During that period , if one of the family members was affected by genetic disorder symptoms , he faced an ethical dilenma ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He had to choose to protect his family and make his family more prosperous despite a potential genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be hidden forever ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the provider in the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion people should think carefully about what the consequences are of telling the relatives about his or her generic disorder issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to develop the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Despite this if the disorder is unlikely to be fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs mental support to go through this situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is hard for an individual to deal with the issue on his or her own ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By telling his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing there and then ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it is better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family members might experience the same thing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check - up for themselves and they could even prevent it from happening to themselves ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious . The carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For every decision there are always pros and cons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I could understand the feeling of the carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family of his or her condition ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in his or her life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could cause huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary form from his or her family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["True enough there are lots of cancer patients who are given second chances to live as normal people as they have strong mental support from their loved ones ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us even if we are fragile and weak ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the techonology ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic testing has been made possible - it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situations worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has a right not to know ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is ' normal ' to everyone in the past as genetic testing was not possible ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It could rather be better for him or her this way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real - life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I personally think this is the right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , I believe that the carrier has a right not to be obligated to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the result turned out to be something that the carrier could not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I also believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the truth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["After discovering he or she is a carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It could possibly cause a problem in a family because of this and create more unhappiness in the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Overall , I believe that it is entirely up to the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he still has no obligation to tell ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic test and take appropriate action with the results ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , without knowing of any genetic disorder and having to accept the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome any diability ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emotional stress ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Debates have been around for years : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Any individual at risk of a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic is worth discussing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is an that needs to be addressed a family - related ethical dilemma is involved ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this essay , some arguments will be pointed out in support the view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We were crying hard but we were not alone . It is our family and relatives that bring us up ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , they should be the people to be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy with ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , there may seem no point in sharing but this involves more than just the sharing of bad news ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it is one 's responsibility to inform family and close relatives ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["as the case is related to genetic risk , with the focus on \" genetic \" which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , I would agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives to avoid any family - related ethical dilemma that could emerge in the future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although one may argue that it is up to the individual to decide to disclose such a health issue or to bear it , it is certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such risk of disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle against such a disorder risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , it will involve more than just one family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This would avoid the rise of more family - related ethical dilemmas ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test is conducted ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , in order to avoid the family - related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his / her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The benefits of doing so outweigh the disadvantages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is in such a position and contemplating whether to inform relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk of a disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is the common law in society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , it leads to a new problem : \" should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ? \""]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This issue has been discussed for a long time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there is still a diversity of points of view among people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence below : \" I will be anxious about my family when he or she tells me that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk \" ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Frequently , the intention of the carriers is not to want to tell their family to continue their own life without anxiety ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than many ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against the demon ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The demon is not easily defeated and much energy is required and psychological support ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides that , the risk of the known genetic disease is so serious that it can not be described ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The seriousness can be worse than our imagination ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Lying on the bed for our remaining days , or even dying quickly : these are the consequences which we can not imagine ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Families are the dearest in our life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without their concern and support , it is hard to stay alive for for a long time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They play an important role in our life which can not be substituted ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the agreement of the carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is the ethic of hospital staff to keep the secret of any patients ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can not blame them if they are liable for undesired consequences ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , hospitals can provide a councilor to advise the carrier about the action that can be taken ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , these kinds of circumstances will not happen again and again ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a method that benefits two which , which is a win - win situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , advice from hospital plays an important role ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of his family and even society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate behaviour , great circumstances for the carrier and families will be created in the future . ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the risk of having genetic disorders , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the fact that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : should they warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Or should they choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my point of view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First of all , from the angle of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They may not want this truth to influence their life and want to keep it as a secret and not let others know about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may cause them to be discriminated against or pitied by others which iare not positive factors in their lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to ask about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a problem , they may just ignore the possibility ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher risk of being genetic risk carriers ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This forces them to accept the truth which may make the rest of their life miserable ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people may argue that establishing the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives because of the early diagnosis ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence and social influence , are taken into consideration ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If one such relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown ; partners , spouses and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other difficulties may emerge which means the relative 's life may be ruined ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This should be accepted from the point of human rights , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For a carrier of genetic disorder , knowing the fact that he or she is a carrier causes more dilemma than getting the disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are four reasons why people should not be scared and should share their problems regarding genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions : physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited to offspring ; and , mentally , if the action fails to prevent it being inherited ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented from happening if the mother undergoes proper medication and does not consume anything harmful during the pregnancy period ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The more people ( relatives ) that her problem , the bigger the information channel provided ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever it can to make a good environment for its children 's growth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is not the parent 's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["So , they have to also prepare mentally ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , genetic diseases are costly for treatment and medication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Albinism is an example ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People with albinism have sensitive skin and this needs regular treatment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If they do not treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are high that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To prevent the bigger problem happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of these diseases is sickle cell trait ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and discloses the information to their relatives , they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and need not be scared because it is for the sake of their children 's health ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give a mental boost to their children with genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People and friends often mock their conditions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If not their family , who else is willing to do that ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared mentally first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this modern world , technologies have improved a lot compared to the last century ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Particularly , in the medical field , there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which is used to diagnose an individual at risk of a genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The medical authorities claim that only the individual who is at risk of a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family - related ethical dilemma is born ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is because his or her relatives have the right to know ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be passed on to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk of a genetic disorder which means that other family members also have equal risk to have it . So this problem should be treated seriously by the family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this demonstrate their right ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk of a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although telling James about this is horrible , he should know what might to happen to him ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , doctors usually cite a dictum , \" Prevention is better than cure \" ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing it , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent it happening by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least doing exercise for 30 minutes every day ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from happening ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Together with the advancement of technology over past decades , medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly evolving . By empowering doctors with advance medical knowledge , doctors are able to diagnose and conduct genetic testing for patients to help prevent illness and take necessary steps to protect their life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , the question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives becomes a challenging issue to both patient and doctor ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , I support the obligation to inform patients ' relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next - of - skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform relatives is important so that necessary preventive actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease , the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child . Hence by making your family members aware of the situation , it might lessen family pressure and suffering forcing you to settle down and have children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns forcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These challenge confidentiality and privacy principles ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal requirement to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient 's wish . ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Early disclosement to family members brings in a positive reaction and facilitates prevention . As in the case of Angelina Jolie who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I can still recall her reason for disclosing her own story ; It was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As in the case of Alzheimer patients , it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret how and to whom should Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise the potential negative impact to family members ( DementiaToday , 2012 ) ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer patients like the Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are still thousands of people with genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving enough help and support from these organizations . Therefore need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is the minimum that patients need in their difficult time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , the state should pass a legal bill to provide information to doctors about to reveal relatives ' family about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to the patient 's decision ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up to benefit themselves and their family members ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although there may be challenges from social ethical issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , study in the field of genetics has progressed further and further due to the high velocity of technological advancement ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) started ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , in the field of genetic testing , people can find about the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology is very advanced already . an even more popular topic arises ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["While most people agree that each individual has his a right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands on whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , the patients , who are carriers of some known genetic risk are obliged to share the truth with their family members ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For the whole society , it is a duty ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street , are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , it is essential to tell family members about the risk of genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and to conserve the family basis ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Family members are one of the closest groups of people from whom patients can get comfort and help them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A study of New York University in 2010 shows that patients with family members around generally recover 2 - 4 days faster than those taken care of by professional nurses ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some people may say that telling the truth may create some unnecessary doubts and panic which will endanger family harmony ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , every family can go through this kind of troublesome situation . The more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater the bond that will be established between the family members as well as the greater the amount of trust , love and understanding ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the words of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you makes you stronger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The courage to take the genetic test and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have something may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest to the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely judge or at least distinguish those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or ' weird ' ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble - Boy disease , autism or down - syndrome ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without their realizing it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a risk of a particular genetic disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is normal for people to demand a fair and similar treatment from others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word ' risk ' and assume that the person is the only one suffering from the disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either become paranoid or judge him and act differently ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Especially when it is just a risk . The option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive after they are born ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to disclose it to their future partner ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full rights to it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He may have different considerations such as disclosing to those who might judge or may making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic risk refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives need to be be informed that their children have genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to have a family and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They may not be to enjoy the normal life people enjoy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he / she is not able to care for himself / herself ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage : medication fees ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that is not able to work and may suffer pain throughout his entire life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are always newspaper reports that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby had diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For countries like Singapore , this is a problem because , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled such as medical subsidizes and building special schools to educate them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without increasing numbers of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other areas like the military and education ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages occur in hospital every day ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is easier for people to accept it morally ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the health of their child ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people may support a theory that every person has the right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have been informed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy from happening ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic testing is a personal choice ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One should have the full control of his / her information and it is his / her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether there could be some genetic diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is not the case I am talking about here ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They have the right to know whether they are at risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He runs a test and finds out that he has the gene AA ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C . They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C . If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene Aa ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["this means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , this can also be achieved from personal choice ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Most people care about their relatives : if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One might also choose to hint or encourage their relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that they come across when they disclose their genetic results ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a person is obliged to tell his / her relatives , he or she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very serious disease ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["after he takes the test , he is obliged to tell his relatives ; everyone knows that he is a carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers . They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Third , it is hard to define relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a gene runs in the family , one of the family members may test positive . Whom does he need to tell ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If that is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Spouses usually have very close relationships . If person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousin has this disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In less than a week , half of the town knows person A has a risk gene , and his family might have a genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his / her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Since the technology of modern society has so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decisions to take genetic tests so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk , which can affect their next generation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And there are two basic reasons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self - wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self - wellness and health of your relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is because if you are carrying that genetic risk , there is a great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just fate what will happen to both you and your relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , if you have undergone a test and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared to fight the disease and even prevent the disease is your responsibility ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , you are also responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Being the parent , you are responsible to your next generation , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and are aware of it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a choice about whether to have a child or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used . You can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is the responsibility of being a parent ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing in the first place ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and are aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To tell or not to tell"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Consider a case : we decide to undergo genetic testing and"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["we find that we actually are a genetic risk carrier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are really a lot of things we need to consider ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Every choice we make may have a huge impact on their whole lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , what should we do ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once we find we are carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And it is important for young people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The earlier we tell them , the better for the rest of their lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What 's more they may undergo genetic tests as well to see whether they are carrying or not which is also better for them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , some people may argue why should we want to interfere with their lives ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future : what kind of feeling are you going to have ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Personally I feel that we still should take responsibility to tell them the situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to treat it in a positive way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can not let it go ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is only after we tell them that they start paying attention to their health ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They will consider whether to have a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby carrying this genetic risk as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones . We need to tell them and help them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic testing is conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused extensive social controversy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He or she has the right not to tell anyone ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This essay will illustrate this in two ways ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First of all , it can be a warning for the family members of the patient and make them aware of the possible disease that they may also have ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genes , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["So for the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are the contrary ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A couple in China had a son of 5 years old ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosed a kind of genetic disease which is very serious ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and could pass only to boys rather than girls ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore their son had inherited the genetic disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , the wife actually had known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The son died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the wife had not hidden the truth and asked for a doctor 's advice before they had baby , the tragedy would not have happened ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and they can seek treatment in time if possible ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Second , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face a disorder problem ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , I think that the genetic information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by law ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are three reasons as follows ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , the information concerning the genetic risk is something personal which is also private like people 's bank card key ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once people 's genetic information is told to other people ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["they may know about the person 's potential disabling disease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They may set a bias on this person even abandon him or her ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought of badly because of a bad gene ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["So I think whatever the genetic situation is or whether the gene matches with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even family or relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even break the relationship between children and parents ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Once his or her family or relatives know , the person may not have anymore contact with them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appearing which would truly destroy the family gradually ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested merely in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and stronger ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The parents give knowledge and love to the children , meanwhile they feel happy with the company of the children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The children rely on the parents to live ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank them for their dedication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Noone wants to see the scene of a broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature at this moment ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There also exists some probability of testing errors ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the testing errors were not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggle for the rest of their lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to genes with the development of the medical technology ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People will know about whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have done the genetic test ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If there is no problem , that will be wonderful ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any diseased genes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , once people find they carry the diseased genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It may be awkward and embarrasing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , so of course they own the same genes in some way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore there is nothing to be shy about or be afraid of ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If a person tells his or her relatives that he or she carries a diseased gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also have a diseased gene ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If the relatives carry the diseased gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help . They will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If he or she is married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he / she carries a diseased gene ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Or else , if he holds on telling about the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There is a story I watched on TV ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time . Their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what the problem was ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["After coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a diseased gene so that they could not have a baby in their life time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce her husband ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["After getting the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the diseased gene instead of the man ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Tears showed nothing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People can not avoid carrying diseased genes , which they are born with ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , they can avoid the diseased genes being passed on to their children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying a diseased gene can make their family members bond closely . Also many risks and conflicts can be avoided ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict for and protect each individual at risk of a disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there rises a family - related ethical dilemma about if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results . While the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and make emotional preparations ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing and the development of her breast cancer risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , I believe it is just the usual reaction in this situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , in some cases the patient and the family may undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , which they need to learn to face as there might be dramatic tragedy such as sickness even death ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Life is hard but people can not call it unfair ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is because they are not strong enough to overcome the hard times ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives becomes worse . People might feel guilty and depressed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is finally revealed , it will be more shocking and upsetting ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , to tell the genetic testing result"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy for each other as well as promote awareness of the need to take care of everyone 's health ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That plays an important role in helping relatives overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary guide them if they wish to conduct a similar genetic test ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The Impact Of Social Media"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I started becoming involved in Facebook one year ago , when I just arrived in Singapore"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["and now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We know each others ' status , changes and so on through the social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMS to each individual any longer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to make it known ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And if you are not on it , you will just get lost ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is becoming even more convenient than talking via the phone since it is free ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space . Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Socia media allows them to inform people about what is going on ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And actually lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people who get lost and so on ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With more convenient and humane communications , the relationship between government and people has largely improved ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social medias ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can know more news and cultures through socia medias ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From this scope , social media has shortened our distance ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , the chances and importance of talking face to face are less since social media is so convenient , advanced and interesting ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["And even if we gather together , more people find they have less topics to talk about than before and choose to dig from their social media again ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When we are far away , social media makes it as if we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we seem to be further than far away ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable as before ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides , there are more people sharing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious and blundering ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For myself , I long for some places after I see beautiful pictures taken by my firneds ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Sometimes I can not sleep well because of excitement ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media makes our lifestyle so fast , which leaves us less time to think about our life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Interpersonal skills , like any other skills require practice ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The burgeoning of social media definitely has its benefits ; but with all good things , it is better to have them in moderation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This improves the connectivity between the users ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , one is able to send notifications and other information we used to have in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The recipient , will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This convenience can be percieved as almost in realtime ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Next , communications are also greatly improved ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the past , many communications were done by one of many such as telegram , snail mail and poor - quality voice calls ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the welcoming of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most of the olden days ' communication methods ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a ' real ' interaction with expressions and gestures ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , it is a good practice not to intensely use social media all the time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Intimate interactions greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly touch ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recepient ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind in coordination ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , one does not train the necessary skills required for proper interpersonal relations ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some have it , some do not ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Fundamentally , those who score lower for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have more closer connection with each other . It is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the contrary , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First , social media networks have a large user base . It helps to link people from different parts of the world ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , although social network takes time from people chatting face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in daily life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , if social network did not exist , business people would need to meet each other face to face and it is time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time to travel , which is wastage ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["It not only affects interpersonal skills but is also bad for people 's health if they spend to much time on social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , social network may leak certain personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe so people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others ' personal information to deceive ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["However , its disadvantages also can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social network sites provide us with many conveniences ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through the phone , we can know his of her latest news by scanning the webpage ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It can help us know more about each other ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It can make people become closer as well ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There is about 50 % of the world 's people who learn about breaking news from social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which spread through Twitter and Facebook ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This caused panic among people who flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this resulted in temporary closure of schools ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a relatively fast speed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["Social media are able to improve relationships and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it would take a relatively long time to send the letter over ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["All - in - all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there is more to come in future ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With just a touch away from any meida / electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with one 's friends without much hassle ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , long distance relationships or friendship can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and ability to reply to these posts , human interaction can be engaged and expanded with ease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms . Meet - ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate is credibility ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We can not be certain for sure about the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We may in actual fact be communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Photos and informations retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , the lack of face - to - face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although emocons can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and their facial expression ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter - personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet - ups ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face - to - face human interaction within its people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what their friends ' recent activity is ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , they still can use phone to make a normal call and message to contact ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Not only does the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like the personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Several arguments have been made regarding how social media actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People can only use electical devices to access internet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Generally people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , they will lose eye contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face - to - face contact communicating ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["a family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork ;"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["a group of friends having high tea in a caf\u00e9 without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["children nowadays do not know what neighbourhood games are and who is staying beside them ; all they know is pressing icons on the screens ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These are some concrete examples of how the socia media reduce face - to - face human contact ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and be lost eventually ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , they will lose the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in the face and not be trained in their conversation skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human beings ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and to read news ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call which costs a lot to normal salaried families ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["He can even talk to his daughter face - to - face using video call via internet ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends recent activity easily ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These are the advantages that save work most of the time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but at the same time harms people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["All of us are living in a technology realm society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It started invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the past , we travelled by ship and now we can use airplane to do so ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we needed to post our letter and now , we can use e - mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From the examples that I have mentioned we can see that distance between us and our loved ones is getting greater ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or perhaps you are away from your family to pursue your studies or career in life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the mediums that we need ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is applicable to these social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The next two paragraphs will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites such as Facebook allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved one even though you are separated by distance ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration especially among youngsters ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , it could affect their lives and studies ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they are distracted ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making a right decision ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is a commonplace in our lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In an increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between indivduals in the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real - life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuals ' daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face - to - face human contact has decreased ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face problems on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students as they always have an option to turn their back to real - life and go online ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self - identity in real life and may not realise how to interact with people in real - life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short - termed and gone quickly adding no value or meaning to the user 's life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , according to research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Most people only post the happiest moments in their lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay : the links among people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , the friendship on such virtual worlds is superficial which is not relevant to real - life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , as numerous profit - driven companies realize about the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish for the customers by uploading many advertisements ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit - driven companies to have access to the information on the users ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible frauds ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real - life , they will not be indulged in them as much as they are now ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach friends no matter what ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or fall apart ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The parents are now the \" friends \" of their kids , and they can now \" follow \" their kids more closely and in real time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced our face - to - face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook accounts in order to keep in touch ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to be connected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his / her updates ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This allows friends that may not have the time to meet up to still be connected in a way ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that pulls us apart ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the time reduction on face - to - face contact ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us \" Today is someone 's birthday \" ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Gone are those times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As time passes , we may have more \" friends \" on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In a nutshell , every sword has two edges ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The users of every social media site needs to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of their impacts on the actual life that we have ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face - to - face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I believe 80 percent of people use social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These sites play the role of connecting people around the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They consist of the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the social media which are of concern in society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First , with regard to the function of social media sites that connect people : everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , we are able to chat with our friends without travelling to the countries ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It saves a lot of money and time and strengthens our relationships although we stay at different places around the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides that , companies also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate meetings with parties of projects from around the world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Substantial costs are saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors which benefits companies more and boosts their profit ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are always two sides to stories ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face - to - face connection between humans ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Since ancient times , humans interact with others face to face ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Without facial expression , it is easier to misunderstand a speaker 's intention ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That is why facial expression is one of the most important elements in social learning ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , \" social media sites will affect writing skills \" . that is the point of view in society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Based on a statistical report , the more of the writing skills are reduced the more time  spent in the social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices so much so that we do not realize the importance of writing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Writing is an essential skill for a person to express their feelings and opinions ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["' Privacy ' : this has been the the most popular word over the last few decades ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Humans have their own rights and privacy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I believe that most of us agree with these terms ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["To utilize the technology well , we should do our best to not only balance the pros and cons but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our next generation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On one hand , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media provides people with the opportunity to get in contact with each other any time and anywhere ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to keep in touch by writing comments ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When our phones are accidentally broken , we can also use the social media to get in contact with our friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in the group chat via social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people to update friends ' statuses and contact friends more frequently ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are still many disadvantages of using social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face - to - face human contact ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["While social media brings convenience to people in life people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face - to - face chatting , which has a time and place requirement ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved in this situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , people 's over - addiction may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over - dependence of virtual social networking ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is a potential danger for teenagers , who are growing , to get hurt ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standards , as well as other show - off situations , may make people 's daily lives more and more grandiose , which is not an accurate growing social trend ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their study and work may be greatly influenced ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , everytime we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In our sophisticated era , , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Geographical borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies are enhanced continuously ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Telephone may have been perceived as the biggest innovation created ever the first time Graham Bell introduced it ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , since the has become popular , telephone has started to give way to social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many advantages are offered to the users ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Let us consider examples from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particulars and addresses may change from time to time . While on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , sharing medium , and other entertainment add - on ( i.e."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["social games ) which allows users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Twitter has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , giving more benefit if used as information sharing media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to send the words quickly , so that only highlighted messages are delivered ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded and long notes can be published ; even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications in our smartphones ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Research shows that face - to - face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a consequence , interpersonal skills are affected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face - to - face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is a reflection of your personality ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This skill requires practice and can not be facilitated completely through social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting pictures in Facebook , updating statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These social media serve a purpose : to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries . But this should nott mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is related to the interpersonal skills that have been mentioned above that are decreasing qualitatively as we are becoming used to facing gadgets , not facing human beings ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a \" false image \" in public ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We tend to only share our happy moments in media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , people think of themselves badly and this may lead to depression and mental disorder ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It also reduces our sympathy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This is a serious social problem and it affects a lot of people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide what to do ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["So , we should never forget to think think about the benefit and disadvantage of every decision that we make ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , the advancement of technologies is improving the lives of many people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In most countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people think that these social media sites benefit communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the advantages of social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes a lot of time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The appearance of social media sites made those problems go away ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also it takes only one or a few seconds for the message to arrive ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As we graduate from a school , we probably lose contact with some of our friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to contact them through a phone or a letter ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["If by phone and letter is the only way to make contact , we would probably not be able to find them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for the connection ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Everything that comes with benefits also has disadvantages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["social media sites also bring some negative impacts for people and society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The advancement of social media sites makes people rely on them so much so that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought on by social media sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face - to - face human communication in real life , which in turn causes the loss of interpersonal skills for many people ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability of people to present their ideas well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a result , they gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought on by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in touch with people and the latest news has become a tremendous demand ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With an increasing number of users of more than a billion from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly their success in playing an important part of our lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , there are arguments that social media life brings a reduction in face - to - face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["First and foremost , all social media sites are free ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["All users need are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Secondly , it helps people to keep in - touch with one another ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thirdly , social media sites keep us up - to - date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click on the refresh button ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing them to create their own groups , pages or sites to share hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter - connected world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , social media sites also have a negative impact on humans"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time socialising and interacting virtually ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees spending their office time on their personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Using text - messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also has a bad effect on us in the long term ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face - to - face interaction with one another ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Hence it lessens valuable interaction between humans and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , there are some false reports and fake IDs on social media sites that people use to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua recently on Facebook ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to a desire not to interact with others in real life by the victim ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , things have advantages and disadvantages and all depends on how we exploit them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology - savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites . However , this does not mean that we should neglect face - to - face human interaction as this plays an even more important aspect in our life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , some people worry about the young generation having problems in face - to - face communication skills ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their disadvantages ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one - week holiday ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The convenience is beyond description ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a ' click ' and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Compared to face - to - face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their real life masks taken off ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 : 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may lie 3 out of 10 times in real life ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That is because we are pretending who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although sometimes genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh - meaning comments , we can minimize those occurrences through strict regulations of content online ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People around the world can easily share their thoughts about their governments ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the examples is the 2012 riots which happened in Egypt and Zambia ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The idea of searching for democracy was passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , as the government controls most of the media ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["these social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulate the thoughts of the public ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Despite this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face - to - face communication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sit quietly together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real - life friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this case , I have to say that to err is human ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites ' roles in connecting people around the world is undeniable ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thanks to those social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Apart from the ease of communication without distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trading can be done through social media as well ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nevertheless , despite these advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as a reduction in face - to - face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as some fraudulent behavior that can be facilitated through social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Through these sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["From a superficial point of view , it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The sharing of information can occur faster through social media as well . That is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account ; for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its followers with headline news ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["That shows how breaking news and information can be shared easily through social media ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without their need to watch or listen to news reports ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started doing business via these sites ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook . Whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can shop and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["I do think there is a difference in it and I believe many of us will agree ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other since the communication is done through written language , and thus the ' tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This will lead to bad inter - personal skills as well as a problem of trust ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Nowadays , we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even ' real ' ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In addition , the privacy issue has become more important nowadays since people have discovered that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider their drawbacks and thus use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and be confronted by their disadvantages in the smallest way possible ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is a common scene to see almost everyone in public transport looking at at a phonee or wearing an ear piece in this modern society today ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same trend ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Some say that it is a necessary step for human evolution ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , they also bring many negative effects such as loss of face - to - face communicating skills which is important in the work place ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even those with whom we have had little contact for a long time ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In the fast pace of our competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries , funny scenes and new information about their friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Personally I am studying overseas and a busy study life keeps me away from contact with my old friends ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Using a common social media site with my friends helps me know what their statuses are nowadays ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Also , I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many of them are busy working and separated from their children ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the Managers in my work place has the same situation ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start new friendships or relationships ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People , who have the same preferences , get connected ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is easier for people to approach each other after finding out about them ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Students can exchange their experiences about their studies even if they are in different countries ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["People are able to share cultures and pretty photos online . Therefore , others can spread joy to others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Thus I believe that social media sites are one of the useful tools to help people get to know each other better ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , social media sites are like a double - edged sword . They also bring some negative effects on our daily lives ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One of the disadvantages that many people are concerned about is that people lose interest in face - to - face communication ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Many people like to use written to present themselves , and lose confidence when they talk to each other ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Although not everyone is good at public relationships even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their interpersonal skills abilities ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , shadow always exists where there is light ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["Social media sites are supposed to be very useful and convenient tools to bring people closer together in this globalised world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We share ideas , stories and forge friendships based on mutual respect ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , communication on social media is largely based on \" broadcasting and listening \" ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses ,"]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["we are actively \" presenting \" fa\u00e7ades of our lifes in front of others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We tend to post pictures with the best looks and status that are funny ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["We broadcast these facades of us to others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The images we choose to present are carefully considered ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["There is an element of seeking attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["They are just scrolling down pages and pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think funny ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["This type of communication does not help to forge interpersonal relationships ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In real life , establishing friendships requires the all - rounded understanding of one another and caring for one another ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to others ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his / her facebook page where he / she carefully chooses what to present ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["However , it is good for sharing information ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends ."]]}

{"gec_outputs": [["I also discover some of my friends ' interests which I find common to myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in ."]]}
{"gec_outputs": [["In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human - based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information - based friendship that requires a mutual interest ."]]}
